# About

**_What is this?_**

Here I share some results from my personal research project - _Algorithmic Trading_. What's the goal of this research project...? To design, investigate, test various algorithms I invent for analysing stock market data.

**_Who am I?_**

I graduated with an MEng from the University of Oxford in 2022 and I have been working as a full-time Software Engineer since graduation, see my LinkedIn for more details about my career: https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrikmaci/.

**_Why am I doing this?_**

I enjoy data science, I enjoy maths, I enjoy coding and, I like to look at stock markets... It's only natural. 

**_Who are you?_**

_Someone Who Also Enjoys Maths & Stock Markets:_ Please enjoy this README **and** please feel free to message me with your opinions/thoughts on the results or methods I share.

_Recruiter/Hiring Manager:_ I am happy to answer any specific questions about this code, from high level design to specific implementations.

**_Notes_**

I will try to keep this file updated as I develop more and more advanced techniques or methods. Hopefully you can come across something you might find interesting.
